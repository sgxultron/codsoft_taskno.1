                <h2>About Me</h2>
                
 <p>A Journey into Web Development Growing up in Nepal, my passion for technology blossomed at an early age. I spent countless hours tinkering with computers, driven by a curiosity to understand how they worked. This fascination led me to pursue studies in Information Technology, specifically aiming for a BIT (Bachelor in Information Technology) degree. I diligently study grade 11 mathematics, balancing my academic pursuits with a full-time job, demonstrating my commitment and discipline. My journey into web development began with an exploration of the vast resources available online. I found myself captivated by the ability to create something visually appealing and functional from scratch. The more I learned, the more I realized that web development was not just a career path, but a passion. I started honing my skills through platforms like Hack The Box, where I worked on various academy tasks. Each challenge and project I undertook enhanced my problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of web technologies. The thrill of overcoming obstacles and the satisfaction of seeing my creations come to life kept me motivated. In addition to my technical skills, I am a disciplined and motivated individual. My rigorous study habits, which include dedicating 3-4 hours daily to learning after an 8-hour work shift, have equipped me with a strong foundation in both theory and practical application. This routine has not only improved my knowledge but also my time management and perseverance. I possess a keen interest in front-end development, particularly in crafting user-friendly interfaces that provide a seamless experience. My background in mathematics aids in logical thinking and problem-solving, essential traits for a successful web developer. I am also enthusiastic about learning back-end technologies to become a well-rounded full-stack developer. In my career, I am looking for opportunities that challenge me and allow me to grow. I aspire to work in an environment where innovation is encouraged, and continuous learning is supported. I aim to contribute to projects that have a meaningful impact, utilizing my skills to solve real-world problems and improve user experiences. Ultimately, my goal is to become a proficient web developer, capable of building robust, scalable, and visually appealing web applications. I am eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals, share knowledge, and contribute to the ever-evolving field of web development.
